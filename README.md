Things to do:

1. Make APIs for student, faculty, and admin members
    a. Students can only view their grades, view faculty history and data, and apply for projects.
    b. Faculties can assign themselves to new courses( usually no conflicts as those are resolved by the respective department ), update grades for all students of a current course taught, move current courses to past, BUT still cannot update their own or any other student's info directly.

2. Add new functionalities in the form of best courses assigned (Gale Shapley), types of course enrolments (CGPA based, FCFS, FCFS stratified, etc). May also add different roles for admin blocks with different levels of authority.# CollegeDatabase_with_OOPs
